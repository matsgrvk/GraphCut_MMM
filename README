Application of the graph cut approach during my master 2 internship in the ESTIMR team (CEA/LSCE) with M.Vrac, S.Thao and G.Mari√©thoz.

1_label_attribution_bias_var_gc.R : graphcut algorithm to combine models from a multimodel ensemble (MME). Code is separated between graphcut, equal-weighting multimodel mean and minimum bias among the MME per grid point.

2_plot_graphs_maps.R : realisation of several tests. Code generates graphs with the same x-axis representing the model used as reference. Y-axis can represent the mean absolute error (MAE), the median of the MAE, the mean of the gradient bias (gradient bias = RMSE of the 4-neighbors of a given grid cell) and the median of the gradient bias. The code generates maps for the mean gradient bias for each reference used.

Each folders contains a README which details its content.
